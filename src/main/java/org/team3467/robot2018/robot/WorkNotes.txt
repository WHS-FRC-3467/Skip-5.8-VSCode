Drivebase currently assumes that NEITHER encoder will count backwards


ToDo:

Gyro as remote TalonSRX sensor?

<Done>TalonSRX internal PID for ArmLift motors? MotionMagic

CANifier for LEDs


<Done>What is "zero" position for ArmLift?

<Done>Manual ArmLift methods need to update SDB
<Done>Add run ControlLoop methods to ArmLift (and have them update SDB)

<Done>ArmLift Encoder Range Right 12344  Left -10709  (zero at bottom; read at top)

ArmLiftTransition:
- Outer control loop is not PID, but just continuous check of ClosedLoopError for both motors
- Set state to new state after successful transition
	- If transition does not complete, need to set state to Unknown
	- If we start this Command in Unknown state, we need to go to HighLow position.
	- If we have stopped due to limit being hit, we need to check to see if we are actually "close enough" before declaring Unknown state
	- Keep motion magic running even after arriving at target in order to hold position
	- If new state is OnStep(0), then end Command
- This command can be stopped at any time by pressing down either stick on Operator pad (also by clicking "Calibrate" on SDB)
- Need special handling for completion of move to HiLo and start of next transition step
- "Toss": use PID instead of MM? Or just use faster cruise velocity? Open hands when near the end (monitor ClosedLoopError)

4/5/2018:

<done>	1) Raise Switch armlift position
<done>	2) Get Auto position info and process it
<done>	3) Implement separate Coast()/Brake() commands
<done>	4) Test Manual drive (unknown state) then resuming state
		5) Lost comms: do encoders really get reset? Or does arm just lose position?
<done>	6) Fix "Calibrate" routine
		7) Code for CAN limit switches
		8) Brake / Coast mode check

		7) Drive Backwards for Autos?
		8) Left/Right Scale Autonomous
		10) Middle Auto: Switch & DriveAngle

Comp Bot Checkout:
1) Insure motors 7 & 8 are same on both
2) Test drive wheels
3) Test ArmLift manual
4) Test ArmLift auto positions

Auto:
Chooser tells which side we are on and priority or definite target
Check field data in loop
Once we have valid data, pick auto routine based on current position and field status:
If right/left switch priority:
	Switch on our side - do switch
	else scale on our side - do scale
	else drive forward
else if right/left scale priority:
	Scale on our side - do scale
	else switch on our side - do switch
	else drive forward
else if right/left switch definite:
	Switch on our side - do switch
	else drive forward
else if right/left scale definite:
	Scale on our side - do scale
	else drive forward
else if middle switch
	do middle switch auto based on owned side
